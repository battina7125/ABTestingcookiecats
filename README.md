Mobile Games A/B Testing with Cookie Cats

Overview
This repository contains an analysis notebook for A/B testing performed on the mobile game "Cookie Cats". The primary objective was to understand the impact of placing a game gate (an obstacle) at different game levels on user retention.

Objective
Determine if placing a game gate at level 30 or level 40 has a significant impact on player retention.

Methodology
Data Exploration: Initial data exploration was conducted to understand the dataset's structure and key metrics.
Data Visualization: Graphical representations were used to visualize the distribution of game rounds played by users for different game versions.

Statistical Analysis: The Chi-squared test was applied to determine if observed differences in retention rates between game versions were statistically significant.

Results
The 7-day retention rate for the game version with the gate at level 30 was significantly higher than that for the version with the gate at level 40.
No significant difference was observed in 1-day retention between the two versions.# ABTestingcookiecats
